# Contributing to Dotfiles Plus

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Dotfiles Plus! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üéØ Project Vision

Dotfiles Plus aims to be the most secure, intelligent, and developer-friendly dotfiles management system. We prioritize:

1. **Security First** - All contributions must maintain our security standards
2. **Developer Experience** - Features should enhance productivity
3. **Reliability** - Code must be tested and stable
4. **Performance** - Optimizations are always welcome

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/anivar/dotfiles-plus.git
cd dotfiles-plus

# Test your setup
./tests/test-suite.sh

# Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# Test your changes
./tests/test-suite.sh
```

### Code Standards
- **Security**: All user input must be sanitized
- **No eval()**: Use secure alternatives to dynamic execution
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking
- **Shell Compatibility**: Support bash 3.2+ and zsh
- **Performance**: Consider lazy loading and caching

## üîí Security Requirements

### Input Validation
All functions that accept user input must use our security framework:

```bash
# Good - secure input handling
_secure_sanitize_input "$user_input"
_secure_validate_input "$command" "^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$"

# Bad - direct execution of user input
eval "$user_input"  # NEVER DO THIS
```

### Command Execution
Use our secure execution framework:

```bash
# Good - secure command execution
_secure_execute_command "git" "status" "--porcelain"

# Bad - shell injection vulnerable
git $user_args  # VULNERABLE
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Required Tests
All contributions must include tests:

```bash
# Add tests to tests/test-suite.sh
test_your_new_feature() {
    echo "Testing your feature..."
    
    # Test success case
    result=$(your_function "valid_input")
    assert_equals "expected" "$result" "Feature works correctly"
    
    # Test security
    your_function "malicious;input" >/dev/null 2>&1
    assert_failure $? "Malicious input rejected"
}
```

### Test Categories
- **Security Tests** - Input sanitization and validation
- **Functionality Tests** - Feature works as expected
- **Integration Tests** - Works with other components
- **Performance Tests** - No significant performance degradation

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```bash
# Document all functions
# Description: What the function does
# Arguments: $1 - description, $2 - description
# Returns: What it returns
# Example: usage example
your_function() {
    local arg1="$1"
    local arg2="$2"
    # Implementation
}
```

### User Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing features
- Add examples to FEATURES.md
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes

## üé® Code Style

### Shell Script Style
```bash
# Use consistent formatting
function_name() {
    local variable="value"
    
    if [[ condition ]]; then
        command
    fi
    
    return 0
}

# Variable naming
local_variable="value"
GLOBAL_CONSTANT="VALUE"
```

### Git Commit Style
```bash
# Format: type(scope): description
feat(ai): add support for new AI provider
fix(security): improve input sanitization 
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(core): add tests for configuration system
```
