## üîÆ Future Considerations

### Potential Features (Research Phase)
- Shell script generation and validation
- Automated documentation from shell history
- Voice input support (where available)
- Terminal multiplexer integration
- CI/CD pipeline assistance

### Community Features
- Public memory templates repository
- Community workflow sharing
- Best practices database
- Integration marketplace

## ‚ùå Explicitly Excluded Features

These don't align with shell-based dotfiles management:
- Image/video generation or processing
- GUI/visual interfaces
- Complex web service integrations
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cloud-dependent functionality

## üìã Design Principles

1. **Shell-First**: Every feature must work naturally in shell environments
2. **Security**: No eval, no arbitrary code execution, sanitized inputs
3. **Performance**: Features cannot slow shell startup or basic operations
4. **Privacy**: All data local by default, explicit opt-in for sharing
5. **Simplicity**: Intuitive commands that follow Unix philosophy
6. **Compatibility**: Support bash 4.0+ and zsh (modern shells only)
7. **Practical**: Focus on real developer workflow improvements

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Priority areas:
- Shell compatibility testing
- Security auditing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation improvements
- Real-world workflow examples
