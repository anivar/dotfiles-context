## 🔮 Future Ideas (2026+)

### Under Consideration
- Voice input for commands
- Terminal multiplexer integration
- IDE synchronization
- Mobile companion app
- Team collaboration features

### Community Requested
- Public template repository
- Workflow marketplace
- Integration hub
- Video tutorials

## ❌ Out of Scope

These features don't align with our shell-first philosophy:
- GUI applications
- Cloud-dependent features
- Image/video generation
- Real-time collaboration
- Web service hosting
- Container orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline management

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Shell-First**: Every feature must enhance terminal productivity
2. **Security**: No eval, sanitized inputs, encrypted storage
3. **Performance**: Cannot slow shell startup or basic operations
4. **Privacy**: Local by default, explicit opt-in for sharing
5. **Simplicity**: Intuitive commands following Unix philosophy
6. **Modern**: Leverage bash 4+ and zsh capabilities fully
7. **Practical**: Solve real developer pain points

## 📊 Success Metrics

- Shell startup time < 100ms
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- 90%+ command success rate
- Active community contributions
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Priority Areas
1. **Security**: Audit and hardening
2. **Performance**: Optimization and benchmarking
3. **Features**: Implement roadmap items
4. **Documentation**: Tutorials and examples
