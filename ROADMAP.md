### Team Features
- Shared memory pools (opt-in)
- Team coding standards enforcement
- Knowledge base integration
- Collaborative debugging sessions

## 🔮 Future Ideas (v3.0+)

### Under Consideration
- IDE synchronization (VSCode, IntelliJ)
- Mobile companion app for quick queries
- Web dashboard for analytics
- AI model fine-tuning on your codebase
- Real-time collaboration features

### Community Requested
- Windows PowerShell support
- Public template marketplace
- Integration with more AI providers
- Workflow automation library
- Video tutorial series

## ❌ Out of Scope

These features don't align with our shell-first philosophy:
- GUI applications
- Cloud-dependent features
- Image/video generation
- Real-time collaboration
- Web service hosting
- Container orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline management

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Shell-First**: Every feature must enhance terminal productivity
2. **Security**: No eval, sanitized inputs, encrypted storage
3. **Performance**: Cannot slow shell startup or basic operations
4. **Privacy**: Local by default, explicit opt-in for sharing
5. **Simplicity**: Intuitive commands following Unix philosophy
6. **Modern**: Leverage bash 4+ and zsh capabilities fully
7. **Practical**: Solve real developer pain points

## 📊 Success Metrics

- Shell startup time < 100ms ✅
- Zero security vulnerabilities ✅
- 90%+ command success rate
- Active community contributions
- Cross-platform compatibility

## 🤝 How to Contribute

### Priority Areas
1. **Testing**: Cross-platform validation
2. **Documentation**: More examples and tutorials
3. **Integrations**: More AI providers and tools
4. **Performance**: Further optimizations
5. **Security**: Ongoing audits
