## 🎯 Why Developers Choose Dotfiles Plus

**Traditional dotfiles are just configuration files. Dotfiles Plus is a complete development environment orchestrator.**

```bash
# Traditional approach
git status
git add .
git commit -m "update stuff"

# Dotfiles Plus approach  
gst              # AI-enhanced git status with insights
ai "review my changes for potential issues"
gc               # Intelligent commit with auto-generated messages
```
