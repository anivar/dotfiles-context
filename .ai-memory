# Dotfiles Plus - AI Memory

## Project Status
- Refactoring from v1.2.0 to v2.0.0 (January 2025)
- Plugin-based architecture implementation (~95% complete)
- Upgraded to Bash 5.0+ requirement
- Minor Zsh compatibility issues remaining

## Key Decisions
- Moved from monolithic to plugin architecture for maintainability
- Chose Bash 5+ for modern features and better arrays/strings
- Implemented all v1.3-v1.6 roadmap features in v2.0
- Created Homebrew formula for easy distribution

## Current Focus
- Fixing remaining Zsh compatibility issues
- Testing multi-shell installation behavior
- Preparing for v2.0.0 release

## Important Context
- Installation only configures current shell, not all shells
- Users want ALL features preserved during refactor
- Clean modular architecture is a priority
- Comprehensive testing before release is critical

## Technical Notes
- Plugins use lazy loading for performance
- Hook system enables extensibility
- Unified `dotfiles` command namespace
- AI features include freeze/thaw, @file syntax, perspectives
