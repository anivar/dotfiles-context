## 🤖 AI Commands

### Basic AI Query
```bash
ai "your question here"
```
Ask any question to your AI assistant. The query is automatically enhanced with context about your current location, repository, and branch.

**Examples:**
```bash
ai "how do I create a git branch?"
ai "explain this error: ECONNREFUSED"
ai "what's the regex for email validation?"
```

### Memory Management

#### `ai remember`
```bash
ai remember "information to save"
```
Stores information at multiple context levels (directory, branch, repository, session). This creates a persistent memory that survives terminal restarts.

**Example:**
```bash
ai remember "API endpoint is at /api/v2/users"
ai remember "working on authentication bug - JWT expiry issue"
```

#### `ai recall`
```bash
ai recall
```
Displays all relevant memories for your current context, organized hierarchically.

**Output includes:**
- Current directory memories
- Current git branch memories
- Repository-wide memories
- Parent directory memories

#### `ai forget`
```bash
ai forget
```
Clears the session context for the current directory. Does not affect other context levels.

### Advanced Context Navigation

#### `ai stack`
```bash
ai stack
```
Shows the context stack navigation - displays directory hierarchy with associated memories at each level.

**Example output:**
```
📚 Context Stack Navigation:
📁 ~/projects/api-backend/src/auth
    └── implementing JWT tokens
  📁 ~/projects/api-backend/src
    └── refactoring authentication module
    📁 ~/projects/api-backend
      └── starting OAuth2 implementation
```

#### `ai projects`
```bash
ai projects
```
Displays memories from all projects you've worked on, giving you a cross-project overview.

**Example output:**
```
📊 Cross-Project Context:
📦 api-backend:
  working on JWT authentication
  need to add rate limiting

📦 frontend-app:
  integrating with new auth API
  update token refresh logic
```

### AI Provider Management

ai help
```
Shows all available AI commands with brief descriptions.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Context Awareness**: The AI system automatically includes context from your current directory, git branch, and repository. You don't need to explain where you are.

2. **Memory Hierarchy**: When you `ai remember` something, it's saved at multiple levels. Switch branches or directories and you'll see relevant memories for that context.

3. **Smart Commits**: Let `gc` suggest commit messages - it analyzes your changes and creates meaningful messages.

4. **Session Isolation**: Each terminal session has its own context. Open multiple terminals for different tasks without context mixing.

5. **Quick Access**: Use the shorter aliases (`remember`, `forget`, `g`) for frequently used commands.
